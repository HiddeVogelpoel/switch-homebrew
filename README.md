# switch-homebrew

A repo for me to dump all my code for switch homebrew.

Examples taken from: [switch-examples made available by switchbrew](https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples)

Current projects:
* `hello-world`: A simple text output program
* `sdl2`: As of 25/10/2021 this folder contains a very basic modification of the [sdl2 example](https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/tree/master/graphics/sdl2) from switchbrew
* `Flappy Bird`: Do I really need to explain this?
